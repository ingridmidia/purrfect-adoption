          1. Assess Your Readiness: Ensure youâ€™re ready for the responsibility of
          pet ownership. Cats need attention, time, and financial resources for
          food, vet care, and other needs.

          2. Consider Your Lifestyle: Think about the type of cat that fits your
          lifestyle. Factors like energy levels, grooming needs, and any
